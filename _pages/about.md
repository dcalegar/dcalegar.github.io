PhD & MSc in Computer Science from PEDECIBA, Uruguay. Computing Systems Engineer from Universidad de la República, Uruguay. Professor and Researcher at Universidad ORT Uruguay. Researcher Level 1 at the Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación (ANII). Researcher Grade 3 at PEDECIBA.

Interests
======

My work lies at the intersection of [Model-Driven Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/model-driven-engineering) (MDE), which prioritizes models as a key element in bridging the gap between business experts and the IT professionals who build and maintain an organization's support systems, and [Business Process Management](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166361521000117) (BPM) for identifying, evaluating, automating, and optimizing business and IT processes. I´m particularly interested in the following areas:

1. [Process mining](https://www.processmining.org/): a data-driven technique that uses algorithms to analyze event logs from IT systems to discover, monitor, and improve business processes.

2. [Agentic Business Process Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03693): the implementation and execution of autonomous AI-based software agents to support BPM activities.
